Pure awk functions to manage arrays.

Started as a bunch of awk arrays utilities to manage arrays with subarrays.

NOTE: many of these functions uses recursion.
For similar (or duplicated) functions like these recursion free, take a look
at the arrayfuncs extension at https://github.com/crap0101/awk_arrayfuncs
